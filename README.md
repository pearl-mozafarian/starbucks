# Guessing Game


### FEATURES:
This application uses Google Geolocation to find the user's current location and performs a search for the number of Starbucks stores within a radius of 2500 meters of the user.
The user is challenged to guess this number.
- If the guess is too high or too low, the application will let the user know.
- The application will keep track of the number of guesses the user enters and show this number of attempts when the user guesses correctly.
- The winner gets to see the map with the locations of Starbucks stores marked on them.

### FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
> - An option for the user to search within a desired radius since in the current code, the radius is set to 2500 meters.
> - User should be able to change their location by entering a zipcode or address.  This will allow the game to continue until either: the user gets a real job, the world ends, or Starbucks is out of business.
> - Win a cup of coffee: guess correctly and the application will prompt you for your email address , then send you an email with a coupon for a free cup of joe using phpMailer.
> - Showing the direction between user's place and the chosen store.
